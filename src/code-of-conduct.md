# Code of Conduct

Rules for being in this webring.

This webring generally follows the [JSConf Code of Conduct](https://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html), with some variations:

1. Anyone found to be harassing folks (whether as part of the webring or otherwise) will be removed from the webring and shunned socially.
2. Sexual language and imagery is tolerated to the extend that all webring members are comfortable with it. To that effect:
3. Each and every member has veto power over the addition of a site to the webring, beforehand and up to a week after the site has been added.
4. If a member wants to remove an existing site from the webring (more than a week after it has been added), please create an issue and we'll have a simple majority vote to decide if the site should be removed.
5. For the purposes of voting, 3 members is a quorum and the vote must be finalized not less than 1 day and not more than 1 week after the issue has been opened.
